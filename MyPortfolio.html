                   <br>
                   As an engineering intern, i got an experience where i supported various engineering tasks with intention of developing technical,social, and ethical skills.

                   <b><u>AI Dietitian</u> </b>
                   <br>
                   Artificial dietician project is an application with artificial intelligence about human diets. 
                   It acts as a diet consultant similar to a real dietician. This system demonstrations correspondingly 
                   as that of a dietician.
                   <br>
                   <b><u> An artificial intelligence application in the field of nutrition and
                     dietetics is a fairly new and important field. Different apps related to nutrition
                      are offered to the use of individuals. The importance of individual nutrition has also
                       triggered the increase in artificial intelligence apps.
                </u></b>
                   <br>
                   AI-based diet planning programs would rely on machine learning and data analytics to create meal plans for your specific 
                   digestive system. AI would analyze the userâ€™s metabolism and digestive system to create an ideal meal plan for their needs.

                   <h3>Production Recommendation System</h3> 
                   <b><em>Research Intern (18 Jun 19-21 Aug 21)</em></b>
                   <br>
                   More investigation of the existing latest works on recommender systems is required which focus on diverse
                    applications. There is hardly any review paper that has categorically synthesized and reviewed the literature
                     of all the classification fields and application domains of recommender systems.
